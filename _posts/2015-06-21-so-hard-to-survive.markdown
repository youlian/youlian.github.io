Etiology of mental ilness... I know quite a lot about it, knowledge born of personal experience, steeped in pain. Stay with me, let me tell you my story...

I have been looking for work for a really long time... Have listened to tons and tons of bullshit, tolerated ridiculous unsults so many times, absorbed the projected fears, insecurities and ignorance and more even ignorance of so many people... Boggles the mind and yet I tried to pay little attention. Trouble is all that noise accumulates and poisons the mind...

No meaningful results, no way to support myself in a honest way... Rejection, exclusion, marginalization... total, complete and permanent. Enforced  by a socirety that pretends the illusion of inclusion is real, simply afraid of admit to itself the illusion diverges heavily from the reality itself... 

Why am I expected to just die out silently? Something in me rejects the idea of going silently into the night. I would like to survive as much as anybody, but for that I need the help of an understanding person. One person will suffice, I have been walking the path of Diogenese, carrying his proverbial lamp for so long...

I can't really eat less often without falling into suspended animation, so to speak. Trying to balance on the edge, without falling over, eating every few days and I have been doing it for years... Hoping that my situation would improve. It haven't.

I am so tired of the constant struggle. ODSP help me physically survive to a small degree, the money is not enough for rent alone, but it helps in the sense that without it that would be my end for good. 

The only person who really helped me was my brother. To him I am forever indepted, so much  that I would never be able to repay him. I asked for help so many people, help to find work, that is. None listened to, including none at CAMH. 

ODSP runs out in several months. If it stops for a month I am as good as dead. 

I need work. I have been looking for work for 5 yrs, trying to survive. I did NOT find any, kept applying for sooo many jobs... Trying to be positive brought me no success. All that positive bullshit, individuals and agencies are peddling proved to be exactly that, worthless bullshit. And yes, there is a whole industry of peddling said bullshit here in Canada, a vampiric industry the feeds on the vulnerable, sucks them dry.  So ultimately, there is money in bullshit, but only and exclusively for those who distribute it.

Intellectual capacity, professional integrity, heaps of skills and decades of experience, the talent of being a very fast learner, extreme book lover with huge background knowledge and with wide interests in science, spirituality, philosophy, always trying to help other people... 

None of the above proved to matter... The struggle took its toll...
 
Denial was my only hope, saying to myself it's just a nightmare, I'll wake up, next month everything will be ok, I'll be an integrated member of society again...

I started loosing my mind in chunks, day by day, night by night... Despair visits me every day and every nigt I look at the empty sockets of death at close range trying to fend it off... Eventually I learned to see the beauty in the face of death, at least there is no bullshit in its domain...

I have given up retirement, given up everything really, but I just can't give up who I am, without signing for a longer stay in death's domain... I still want to survive for 5- max 10 yrs, hopefully saving enough for a funeral in the meantime...

Please, anybody... help me survive.
